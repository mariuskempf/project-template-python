# Python Project Template

Empty Python project template.

## Getting Started

The following steps help you to set things up and get started quickly.

0. Ensure you have [Poetry 1.8](https://python-poetry.org/docs/1.8/#installation) installed and a python environment configured and activated:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

1. Install dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev
   ```

2. Activate pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Repository Structure

The following briefly explains the structure of the project template.

## Considerations

### Ruff Instead of Black

Add the following to `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
...
ruff = "^0.12.7"

[tool.ruff]
# Ruff linter configuration. See: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/
line-length = 120
target-version = "py310"
src = ["app"]
```
